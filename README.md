This repository contains all the notebooks and the final report (styled as a journal paper) for the study titled "MalwareInSight: Classifying Malware Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks." The study investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the problem of malware classification through image analysis, comparing custom architectures against well-known pre-trained models.

## Abstract
Traditional signature-based malware detection methods are often outpaced by the rapid evolution of malware. This study builds on the innovative approach by Nataraj et al. (2011) to convert malware code into grayscale images, leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance malware classification. Utilizing the MalImg dataset, this research explores the efficacy of custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures versus pre-trained models like VGG16 and VGG19. The custom CNN, named MalwareInSight, achieved a superior 99.05% accuracy, surpassing previous benchmarks. The study highlights the limitations of data augmentation techniques and complex architectures for malware images. The findings advocate for the commercial viability of malware image classification as a complementary tool to existing methods. Recommendations include expanding datasets, integrating texture-based pre-trained models, and exploring unsupervised learning for future studies.
